- *Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras*
- *ResNet18 (CNN), SVM, Decision Tree*
- *OpenCV* – for image processing
- *LangChain & OpenAI API* – for chatbot
- *Flask, HTML/CSS* – for web interface

##  Key Features
- Behavioral data classification using ML models
- Facial image analysis using CNN (ResNet18)
- Fusion-based final prediction
- NLP-powered chatbot for user assistance
- Web interface for easy access

##  Datasets Used
- Autism Spectrum Quotient (Kaggle)
- Autism Facial Image Dataset (cihan063/autism-image-data)
